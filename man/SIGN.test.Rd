\usage{
SIGN.test(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  md = 0,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  conf.level = 0.95,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector; \code{NA}s and \code{Inf}s are allowed but will be
removed.}

\item{y}{optional numeric vector; \code{NA}s and \code{Inf}s are allowed but
will be removed.}

\item{md}{a single number representing the value of the population median
specified by the null hypothesis}

\item{alternative}{is a character string, one of \code{"greater"},
\code{"less"}, or \code{"two.sided"}, or the initial letter of each,
indicating the specification of the alternative hypothesis. For one-sample
tests, \code{alternative} refers to the true median of the parent population
in relation to the hypothesized value of the median.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval,
restricted to lie between zero and one}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{htest_S}, containing the following components:
\item{statistic}{the S-statistic (the number of positive differences between
the data and the hypothesized median), with names attribute \dQuote{S}.}
\item{p.value}{the p-value for the test} 
\item{conf.int}{is a confidence interval (vector of length 2) for the true 
median based on linear interpolation. The confidence level is recorded in the attribute
\code{conf.level}. When the alternative is not \code{"two.sided"}, the
confidence interval will be half-infinite, to reflect the interpretation of
a confidence interval as the set of all values \code{k} for which one would
not reject the null hypothesis that the true mean or difference in means is
\code{k}. Here infinity will be represented by \code{Inf}.}
\item{estimate}{is avector of length 1, giving the sample median; this
estimates the corresponding population parameter. Component \code{estimate}
has a names attribute describing its elements.} 
\item{null.value}{is the value of the median specified by the null hypothesis. 
This equals the input argument \code{md}. Component \code{null.value} has a 
names attribute describing its elements.} 
\item{alternative}{records the value of the input argument alternative: 
\code{"greater"}, \code{"less"}, or \code{"two.sided"}} 
\item{data.name}{a character string (vector of length 1)
containing the actual name of the input vector \code{x}}
\item{Confidence.Intervals}{a 3 by 3 matrix containing the lower achieved 
confidence interval, the interpolated confidence interval, and the upper 
achived confidence interval}
}
\description{
This function will test a hypothesis based on the sign test and reports
linearly interpolated confidence intervals for one sample problems.
}
\details{
Computes a \dQuote{Dependent-samples Sign-Test} if both \code{x} and
\code{y} are provided.  If only \code{x} is provided, computes the
\dQuote{Sign-Test}.
}
\note{
The reported confidence interval is based on linear interpolation. The
lower and upper confidence levels are exact.
}
\section{Null Hypothesis}{
 For the one-sample sign-test, the null hypothesis
is that the median of the population from which \code{x} is drawn is
\code{md}. For the two-sample dependent case, the null hypothesis is that
the median for the differences of the populations from which \code{x} and
\code{y} are drawn is \code{md}. The alternative hypothesis indicates the
direction of divergence of the population median for \code{x} from \code{md}
(i.e., \code{"greater"}, \code{"less"}, \code{"two.sided"}.)

\examples{

x <- c(7.8, 6.6, 6.5, 7.4, 7.3, 7., 6.4, 7.1, 6.7, 7.6, 6.8)
SIGN.test(x, md = 6.5)
        # Computes two-sided sign-test for the null hypothesis 
        # that the population median for 'x' is 6.5. The alternative 
        # hypothesis is that the median is not 6.5. An interpolated 95\% 
        # confidence interval for the population median will be computed.
        
reaction <- c(14.3, 13.7, 15.4, 14.7, 12.4, 13.1, 9.2, 14.2, 
              14.4, 15.8, 11.3, 15.0)
SIGN.test(reaction, md = 15, alternative = "less")
        # Data from Example 6.11 page 330 of Kitchens BSDA.  
        # Computes one-sided sign-test for the null hypothesis 
        # that the population median is 15.  The alternative 
        # hypothesis is that the median is less than 15.  
        # An interpolated upper 95\% upper bound for the population 
        # median will be computed.
