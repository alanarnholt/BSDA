\arguments{
\item{mean.x}{a single number representing the sample mean of \code{x}}

\item{s.x}{a single number representing the sample standard deviation for
\code{x}}

\item{n.x}{a single number representing the sample size for \code{x}}

\item{mean.y}{a single number representing the sample mean of \code{y}}

\item{s.y}{a single number representing the sample standard deviation for
\code{y}}

\item{n.y}{a single number representing the sample size for \code{y}}

\item{alternative}{is a character string, one of \code{"greater"},
\code{"less"} or \code{"two.sided"}, or just the initial letter of each,
indicating the specification of the alternative hypothesis. For one-sample
tests, \code{alternative} refers to the true mean of the parent population
in relation to the hypothesized value \code{mu}.  For the standard
two-sample tests, \code{alternative} refers to the difference between the
true population mean for \code{x} and that for \code{y}, in relation to
\code{mu}.  For the one-sample and paired t-tests, \code{alternative} refers
to the true mean of the parent population in relation to the hypothesized
value \code{mu}. For the standard and Welch modified two-sample t-tests,
\code{alternative} refers to the difference between the true population mean
for \code{x} and that for \code{y}, in relation to \code{mu}.  For the
one-sample t-tests, alternative refers to the true mean of the parent
population in relation to the hypothesized value \code{mu}. For the standard
and Welch modified two-sample t-tests, alternative refers to the difference
between the true population mean for \code{x} and that for \code{y}, in
relation to \code{mu}.}

\item{mu}{is a single number representing the value of the mean or
difference in means specified by the null hypothesis.}

\item{var.equal}{logical flag: if \code{TRUE}, the variances of the parent
populations of \code{x} and \code{y} are assumed equal. Argument
\code{var.equal} should be supplied only for the two-sample tests.}

\item{conf.level}{is the confidence level for the returned confidence
interval; it must lie between zero and one.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{htest}, containing the following components:
\item{statistic}{the t-statistic, with names attribute \code{"t"}}
\item{parameters}{is the degrees of freedom of the t-distribution associated
with statistic.  Component \code{parameters} has names attribute
\code{"df"}.} \item{p.value}{the p-value for the test.} \item{conf.int }{is
a confidence interval (vector of length 2) for the true mean or difference
in means. The confidence level is recorded in the attribute
\code{conf.level}. When alternative is not \code{"two.sided"}, the
confidence interval will be half-infinite, to reflect the interpretation of
a confidence interval as the set of all values \code{k} for which one would
not reject the null hypothesis that the true mean or difference in means is
\code{k} . Here infinity will be represented by \code{Inf}.}
\item{estimate}{vector of length 1 or 2, giving the sample mean(s) or mean
of differences; these estimate the corresponding population parameters.
Component \code{estimate} has a names attribute describing its elements.}
\item{null.value}{the value of the mean or difference in means specified by
the null hypothesis. This equals the input argument \code{mu}. Component
\code{null.value} has a names attribute describing its elements.}
\item{alternative}{records the value of the input argument alternative:
\code{"greater"} , \code{"less"} or \code{"two.sided"}.} \item{data.name}{a
character string (vector of length 1) containing the names x and y for the
two summarized samples.}
}
\description{
Performs a one-sample, two-sample, or a Welch modified two-sample t-test
based on user supplied summary information. Output is identical to that
produced with \code{t.test}.
}
\details{
If \code{y} is \code{NULL}, a one-sample t-test is carried out with
\code{x}. If y is not \code{NULL}, either a standard or Welch modified
two-sample t-test is performed, depending on whether \code{var.equal} is
\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.
}
\section{Null Hypothesis}{
 For the one-sample t-test, the null hypothesis is
that the mean of the population from which \code{x} is drawn is \code{mu}.
For the standard and Welch modified two-sample t-tests, the null hypothesis
is that the population mean for \code{x} less that for \code{y} is
\code{mu}.

The alternative hypothesis in each case indicates the direction of
divergence of the population mean for \code{x} (or difference of means for
\code{x} and \code{y}) from \code{mu} (i.e., \code{"greater"},
\code{"less"}, or \code{"two.sided"}).

        # level of air polution is no greater than 4.9 ppm.  A random
        # sample of 16 readings resulted in a sample mean of 5.6 ppm,
        # and s=2.1 ppm.  One-sided one-sample t-test.  The null 
        # hypothesis is that the population mean for 'x' is 4.9.
