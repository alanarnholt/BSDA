z.test(
  x,

  alternative = "two.sided",

\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector; \code{NA}s and \code{Inf}s are allowed but will be
removed.}

\item{y}{numeric vector; \code{NA}s and \code{Inf}s are allowed but will be
removed.}

\item{alternative}{character string, one of \code{"greater"}, \code{"less"}
or \code{"two.sided"}, or the initial letter of each, indicating the
specification of the alternative hypothesis. For one-sample tests,
\code{alternative} refers to the true mean of the parent population in
relation to the hypothesized value \code{mu}. For the standard two-sample
tests, \code{alternative} refers to the difference between the true
population mean for \code{x} and that for \code{y}, in relation to
\code{mu}.}

\item{mu}{a single number representing the value of the mean or difference
in means specified by the null hypothesis}

\item{sigma.x}{a single number representing the population standard
deviation for \code{x}}

\item{sigma.y}{a single number representing the population standard
deviation for \code{y}}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval,
restricted to lie between zero and one}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{htest}, containing the following components:
\item{statistic}{the z-statistic, with names attribute \code{"z"}}
\item{p.value}{the p-value for the test} \item{conf.int}{is a confidence
interval (vector of length 2) for the true mean or difference in means. The
confidence level is recorded in the attribute \code{conf.level}.  When
alternative is not \code{"two.sided"}, the confidence interval will be
half-infinite, to reflect the interpretation of a confidence interval as the
set of all values \code{k} for which one would not reject the null
hypothesis that the true mean or difference in means is \code{k} . Here
infinity will be represented by \code{Inf}.} \item{estimate}{vector of
length 1 or 2, giving the sample mean(s) or mean of differences; these
estimate the corresponding population parameters. Component \code{estimate}
has a names attribute describing its elements.} \item{null.value}{is the
value of the mean or difference in means specified by the null hypothesis.
This equals the input argument \code{mu}. Component \code{null.value} has a
names attribute describing its elements.} \item{alternative}{records the
value of the input argument alternative: \code{"greater"}, \code{"less"} or
\code{"two.sided"}.} \item{data.name}{a character string (vector of length
1) containing the actual names of the input vectors \code{x} and \code{y}}
}
\description{
This function is based on the standard normal distribution and creates
confidence intervals and tests hypotheses for both one and two sample
problems.
}
\details{
If \code{y} is \code{NULL}, a one-sample z-test is carried out with
\code{x}.  If y is not \code{NULL}, a standard two-sample z-test is
performed.
}
\section{Null Hypothesis}{
 For the one-sample z-test, the null hypothesis is
that the mean of the population from which \code{x} is drawn is \code{mu}.
For the standard two-sample z-tests, the null hypothesis is that the
population mean for \code{x} less that for \code{y} is \code{mu}.

The alternative hypothesis in each case indicates the direction of
divergence of the population mean for \code{x} (or difference of means for
\code{x} and \code{y}) from \code{mu} (i.e., \code{"greater"},
\code{"less"}, \code{"two.sided"}).

\examples{

x <- rnorm(12)
z.test(x,sigma.x=1)
        # Two-sided one-sample z-test where the assumed value for
        # sigma.x is one. The null hypothesis is that the population
        # mean for 'x' is zero. The alternative hypothesis states
        # that it is either greater or less than zero. A confidence
        # interval for the population mean will be computed.

x <- c(7.8, 6.6, 6.5, 7.4, 7.3, 7., 6.4, 7.1, 6.7, 7.6, 6.8)
y <- c(4.5, 5.4, 6.1, 6.1, 5.4, 5., 4.1, 5.5)
z.test(x, sigma.x=0.5, y, sigma.y=0.5, mu=2)
        # Two-sided standard two-sample z-test where both sigma.x
        # and sigma.y are both assumed to equal 0.5. The null hypothesis
        # is that the population mean for 'x' less that for 'y' is 2.
        # The alternative hypothesis is that this difference is not 2.
        # A confidence interval for the true difference will be computed.

z.test(x, sigma.x=0.5, y, sigma.y=0.5, conf.level=0.90)
        # Two-sided standard two-sample z-test where both sigma.x and
        # sigma.y are both assumed to equal 0.5. The null hypothesis
        # is that the population mean for 'x' less that for 'y' is zero.
        # The alternative hypothesis is that this difference is not
        # zero.  A 90\% confidence interval for the true difference will
        # be computed.
