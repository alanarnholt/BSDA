\arguments{
\item{mean.x}{a single number representing the sample mean of \code{x}}

\item{sigma.x}{a single number representing the population standard
deviation for \code{x}}

\item{n.x}{a single number representing the sample size for \code{x}}

\item{mean.y}{a single number representing the sample mean of \code{y}}

\item{sigma.y}{a single number representing the population standard
deviation for \code{y}}

\item{n.y}{a single number representing the sample size for \code{y}}

\item{alternative}{is a character string, one of \code{"greater"},
\code{"less"} or \code{"two.sided"}, or the initial letter of each,
indicating the specification of the alternative hypothesis. For one-sample
tests, \code{alternative} refers to the true mean of the parent population
in relation to the hypothesized value \code{mu}. For the standard two-sample
tests, \code{alternative} refers to the difference between the true
population mean for \code{x} and that for \code{y}, in relation to
\code{mu}.}

\item{mu}{a single number representing the value of the mean or difference
in means specified by the null hypothesis}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval,
restricted to lie between zero and one}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{htest}, containing the following components:
\item{statistic}{the z-statistic, with names attribute \code{z}.}
\item{p.value}{the p-value for the test} \item{conf.int }{is a confidence
interval (vector of length 2) for the true mean or difference in means. The
confidence level is recorded in the attribute \code{conf.level}. When
alternative is not \code{"two.sided"}, the confidence interval will be
half-infinite, to reflect the interpretation of a confidence interval as the
set of all values \code{k} for which one would not reject the null
hypothesis that the true mean or difference in means is \code{k}. Here,
infinity will be represented by \code{Inf}.} \item{estimate}{vector of
length 1 or 2, giving the sample mean(s) or mean of differences; these
estimate the corresponding population parameters. Component \code{estimate}
has a names attribute describing its elements.} \item{null.value}{the value
of the mean or difference in means specified by the null hypothesis. This
equals the input argument \code{mu}. Component \code{null.value} has a names
attribute describing its elements.} \item{alternative}{records the value of
the input argument alternative: \code{"greater"} , \code{"less"} or
\code{"two.sided"}. } \item{data.name}{a character string (vector of length
1) containing the names \code{x} and \code{y} for the two summarized
samples}
}
\description{
This function is based on the standard normal distribution and creates
confidence intervals and tests hypotheses for both one and two sample
problems based on summarized information the user passes to the function.
Output is identical to that produced with \code{z.test}.
}
\details{
If \code{y} is \code{NULL} , a one-sample z-test is carried out with
\code{x} . If y is not \code{NULL}, a standard two-sample z-test is
performed.
}
\section{Null Hypothesis}{
 For the one-sample z-test, the null hypothesis is
that the mean of the population from which \code{x} is drawn is \code{mu}.
For the standard two-sample z-tests, the null hypothesis is that the
population mean for \code{x} less that for \code{y} is \code{mu}.

The alternative hypothesis in each case indicates the direction of
divergence of the population mean for \code{x} (or difference of means of
\code{x} and \code{y}) from \code{mu} (i.e., \code{"greater"} ,
\code{"less"}, \code{"two.sided"} ).

\examples{

zsum.test(mean.x=56/30,sigma.x=2, n.x=30, alternative="greater", mu=1.8)
        # Example 9.7 part a. from PASWR.
x <- rnorm(12)
zsum.test(mean(x),sigma.x=1,n.x=12)
        # Two-sided one-sample z-test where the assumed value for
        # sigma.x is one. The null hypothesis is that the population
        # mean for 'x' is zero. The alternative hypothesis states
        # that it is either greater or less than zero. A confidence
        # interval for the population mean will be computed.
        # Note: returns same answer as:
z.test(x,sigma.x=1)
        #
x <- c(7.8, 6.6, 6.5, 7.4, 7.3, 7.0, 6.4, 7.1, 6.7, 7.6, 6.8)
y <- c(4.5, 5.4, 6.1, 6.1, 5.4, 5.0, 4.1, 5.5)
zsum.test(mean(x), sigma.x=0.5, n.x=11 ,mean(y), sigma.y=0.5, n.y=8, mu=2)
        # Two-sided standard two-sample z-test where both sigma.x
        # and sigma.y are both assumed to equal 0.5. The null hypothesis
        # is that the population mean for 'x' less that for 'y' is 2.
        # The alternative hypothesis is that this difference is not 2.
        # A confidence interval for the true difference will be computed.
        # Note: returns same answer as:
z.test(x, sigma.x=0.5, y, sigma.y=0.5)
        #
zsum.test(mean(x), sigma.x=0.5, n.x=11, mean(y), sigma.y=0.5, n.y=8,

        # sigma.y are both assumed to equal 0.5. The null hypothesis
        # is that the population mean for 'x' less that for 'y' is zero.
        # The alternative hypothesis is that this difference is not
        # zero.  A 90\% confidence interval for the true difference will
        # be computed.  Note: returns same answer as:
